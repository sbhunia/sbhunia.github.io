### Problem Statement and Motivation

This research focuses on improving how mobile and emergency communication networks perform, especially in challenging situations like natural disasters. One of his key projects, EdgeKeeper, is designed to help first responders, like firefighters and paramedics, communicate more effectively when traditional networks are down. Imagine a team of rescue workers equipped with mobile devices that can form their own mini-network, allowing them to share information and coordinate better during emergencies. EdgeKeeper ensures that this network remains reliable even if some devices stop working or lose connection. It manages essential tasks like naming devices, storing important information, and monitoring the network's status, making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.
