### Problem Statement and Motivation

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, traditional systems in various sectors, such as healthcare transportation and academic peer review, face significant challenges. Healthcare transportation often suffers from inefficiencies, resource wastage, and a lack of transparency, leading to higher costs and delayed services. Similarly, the academic peer review process struggles with low reviewer participation, delayed submissions, and insufficient recognition for reviewers’ contributions. These issues stem from the reliance on outdated, centralized systems that lack the flexibility, security, and transparency needed to meet modern demands. There is a critical need for innovative solutions that can address these challenges by leveraging advanced technologies.


The motivation behind this research is to explore and develop blockchain-based applications that can transform traditional systems into smarter, more efficient, and secure platforms. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized nature and inherent security features, offers a promising solution to the problems faced in healthcare transportation and academic peer review. By introducing blockchain-enabled systems like SCeFSTA and BARIT, we aim to create transparent, fair, and efficient processes that reduce costs, optimize resources, and provide appropriate recognition to contributors. This research is driven by the belief that integrating blockchain technology into these critical areas can significantly improve their performance, ultimately contributing to the development of a smart human-computer society.
