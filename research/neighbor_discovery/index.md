### Problem Statement and Motivation
Directional  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  /  Free-Space-Optical (FSO) transceivers have the potential to play a significant role  in  future  generation  wireless  networks.  They  are  advantageous  in  terms  of  improved  spectrum  utilization,  higher  data transfer  rate,  and  lower  probability  of  interception  from  unwanted sources. Despite these advantages, communications using directional  transceivers  require  establishment  and  maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS). Thus, establishment of the communication link or neighbor discovery plays an important role in mobile ad hoc networks with RF/FSO directional transceivers. We consider two  nodes  (Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicles  (UAVs)  or  Quadcopters) hovering   in   3D   space,   each   with   one   directional   transceiver mounted  on  a  mechanically  steerable  spherical  structure/head,
with which they can scan 360<sup>o</sup> in the horizontal plane and 360<sup>o</sup> in  the  vertical  plane.  We  propose  a  novel  scheme  that  deals with  the  problem  of  automatic  discovery  and  establishment  of LOS  alignment  between  these  nodes.
