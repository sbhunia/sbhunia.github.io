- title: Blockchain-based Application for Privacy and Reliability
  img: "images/blockchain.png"
  desc: |
     This research focuses on using blockchain technology to create smarter and more 
     efficient systems that benefit society. We developed tools like SCeFSTA 
     and BARIT, which use blockchain to solve real-world problems. SCeFSTA helps 
     improve healthcare transportation by making it easier to manage resources, 
     ensure payments are secure, and allow different providers to compete fairly. 
     On the other hand, BARIT is designed to make the academic peer review process
      better by rewarding reviewers in a secure and anonymous way. Through these
       projects, we show how blockchain can be used to create systems that 
       are not only more secure but also more fair and efficient, helping to build 
       a smarter and more connected world.

  desc: |
    This research focuses on improving how mobile and emergency communication networks perform, 
    especially in challenging situations like natural disasters. 
    One of his key projects, EdgeKeeper, is designed to help first 
    responders, like firefighters and paramedics, communicate more 
    effectively when traditional networks are down. Imagine a team 
    of rescue workers equipped with mobile devices that can form 
    their own mini-network, allowing them to share information and
     coordinate better during emergencies. EdgeKeeper ensures that 
     this network remains reliable even if some devices stop working 
     or lose connection. It manages essential tasks like naming devices, 
     storing important information, and monitoring the network's status, 
     making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

- title: Preserving Privacy and Security in Wireless Networks

    The cellular phone system represents the most ubiquitous and trusted communication infrastructure in the world.
    The cellular system has evolved a lot in the past two decades, starting from a basic audio communication system
    to the current smart phone system. In the last few months, the COVID pandemic has made us realize the cellular network's enormous
    importance more, and it has become the most integral part of human life. As the whole nation is looking forward to the jump
    from 4G to 5G LTE network, we look for the brighter side of 100x faster download speed, 10x decrease in latency,
    and 100x increase in network capacity. However, with all these advantages comes a greater risk of privacy of the users.
    The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA) director Christopher Krebs stated in the August 2020 report
    “From my perspective, 5G is the single biggest critical infrastructure build that the globe has seen in the last 25 years and,
    coupled with the growth of cloud computing, automation, and future of artificial intelligence, demands focused attention today to secure tomorrow.”
    To achieve higher bandwidth and broader coverage, the 5G loosen the network architecture's tight control, which opens several vulnerabilities.

- title: Sustainance against Jamming using Honeynet in Cognitive Radio Network
  img: "images/cahannel_allocation.jpg"
  desc: |
    Open and dynamic spectrum access model brings forth a serious challenge of sustenance among the CRN
    and makes them more susceptible to jamming-based denial of service (DoS) attacks. Inspired by
    honeypot in the network security, we propose a honeynet based defense mechanism called CR-honeynet.
    CR-honeynet aims to avoid attacks on legitimate communications by dedicating a Secondary User (SU) as a honeynode,
    to deter the attacker from attacking legitimate SUs and attack the honeynode instead.

- title: Neighbor Discovery for Directional Tranceivers
  img: "images/network.png"
  desc: |
    Directional  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  /  Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers have the potential
    to play a significant role in  future generation  wireless networks.  They are  advantageous in
    terms of  improved spectrum  utilization,  higher data transfer rate,  and lower  probability of
    interception  from unwanted sources. Despite these advantages, communications using directional
    transceivers require  establishment and  maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS). Thus, the establishment
    of the communication link or neighbor discovery plays a significant role in mobile ad hoc networks
    with RF/FSO directional transceivers. In this project, we design protocols for discovering LOS
    of a neighbor for both in-band and out-of-band cases.

- title: Mitigate Jamming using Adaptive Beamforming Antenna
  img: "images/multi_hop_routing_3d.png"
  desc: |
    In multihop ad hoc networks, a jammer can drastically disrupt the flow of
    information by intentionally interfering with links between a subset of nodes.
    The impact of such attacks can escalate when the jammer is moving. As a countermeasure for
    such attacks, adaptive beam-forming techniques can be employed for spatial filtering of the
    jamming signal. This paper investigates the performance of adaptive beam nulling
     as a mitigation technique against jamming attacks in multihop ad hoc networks.
     Considering a moving jammer, a distributed beam nulling framework is proposed.

- title: Frequency Agile Radio Testbed
  img: "images/dsa.png"
  desc: |
    Rampant dynamic spectrum allocation over time leads to the creation of narrow
    spectrum holes which can be aggregated to fulfill the bandwidth requirements of
    users. Even though this approach increases the throughput, it comes at the
    cost of degraded spectrum utilization due to a rise in the number of required
    guard bands. This project aims at how a transmitter- receiver pair can
    coordinate among themselves on choosing the correct frequency and bandwidth
    for actual data communication. The next objective is to optimize the spectrum
    usage of each transmission such that the nodes can dynamically adapt to the
    environment and enhance resource utilization.

- title:  3D Obstacle Compliant Mobility Models for UAV networks in ns-3
  img:  "images/uav_mesh_3d_ns3.svg"
  desc: |
    UAV networks are envisioned to play a crucial role in the future generations
    of wireless networks. Due to the high cost of failures in system-based tests,
    initial analysis and refinement of designs and algorithms for UAV applications
    are performed through rigorous simulations. To facilitate such simulations for
    UAV systems, we presents different mobility models for emulation of a UAV's
     movement. We further extend these models by considering the effect of large
     obstacles on movement patterns following the three models. The mobility models
      are prepared as open-source add-ons for ns-3 network simulator.

- title: Enhance Performance of Voice Service for Congested Network

    This research focuses on improving Voice over IP (VoIP) performance on 
    wireless networks, ensuring clearer and more reliable internet voice
     calls. One of his significant contributions involves optimizing 
     Wi-Fi networks for better VoIP quality. He developed a unique method
      to adjust network settings, reducing issues like dropped calls and 
      delays. This was tested using a simulation program, which showed 
      notable improvements in call quality. Additionally, Dr. Bhunia 
      studied the performance of WiMAX, a wireless technology that 
      covers larger areas than Wi-Fi, especially when users are mobile, 
      such as in cars or trains. He discovered that using adaptive 
      modulation and coding (AMC) techniques enhances the performance 
      for high-speed mobile users. His research identified the extended 
      real-time polling service (ertPS) as the best scheduling service 
      for VoIP applications due to its balance of delay, jitter, and 
      packet loss.

    In WiMAX deployment, the challenges to service providers lie with the Quality
    of Service (QoS) under varying fading environment while at the same time maximizing
    for resource utilization. In this research, a rigorous and comprehensive
    performance study of mobile WiMAX     has  been  made  with  respect  to
    adaptive  modulation  and  coding  techniques  considering  the  variation  in
    the speed of the mobile, path-loss, scheduling services and application
    type for comparing with the fixed     type of modulations.
